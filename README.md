MY LEARNING JOURNEY

My journey in web development has been an exciting and fulfilling one. Starting from scratch, I've delved deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, understanding how they work together to create beautiful and interactive web pages. As I progressed, I learned about popular frameworks like React,Express.js and jwt, which have empowered me to build more complex and feature-rich web applications. Through continuous learning, hands-on projects,I've honed my skills in front-end and back-end development and responsive web design. Each challenge I've faced has been an opportunity for growth, and I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of web development.
